## Advanced Remote Sensing Imaging and Analytics Lab
This git repo is to create, update, organize and archive the designs, code and data developed as part of research projects carried out at the Advanced Remote Sensing Imaging and Analytics Lab at the University of Connecticut.

Based on the project you are currently working check to see if there is an already existing repo avaialble checkout code for your project and continue or if there is no repository you can create a repo and add your contributions. Make sure you always have your current version of your work on the repo. You can maintain your work as a public repo or private repo. When sharing among group memebrs make sure that you always share using the repo rather than sharing code via email / slack / shared drive.

When sharing your code, make sure you always provide all the information required for another person to be able to use/reproduce your work. Extra effort put into documentation will always help.

#### Organizing
It is always going to be hard to decide if you should create a new repo or put your work in an existing repo withn the site for the lab. Make your own judgement call we can always reorganize later by refactoring or combining. Few guidleines on when to create a new rep ...... 
1. If it is a diffent project within the lab
2. Same project but using a completely different aproach and data
3. ....

When **NOT** to create new repo, and create a branch
1. Same code with a modification to the code
2. Same code but different experiment
